# jessicadigital/simplegooglemaps

This javascript module provides an easy way to create static google maps on your website. Google maps data is specified in JSON format (i.e. an array), allowing for easy dynamic creation by scripting languages such as PHP.

### Installation

To install, add the bower module to your project:

```bower install simplegooglemaps --save-dev```

### Setup

The only setup you need to do is to generate a Google Maps Javascript API key, and declare this as a global variable.

### Examples

For examples of the script in use, see the ```demo``` folder. These examples mirror those in the Google documentation for easy reference.
